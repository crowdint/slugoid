# slugoid

Whenever you use MongoDB and Mongoid, there's a high chance you will end up preparing your urls
with a slug instead of the traditional ids because MongoDB ids are ugly.

This gem will help you generate slugs in an easy way

## Compatibility

So far it works with the Rails 3 version of Mongoid.

### Attention

If you're using mongoid 2.0.0.rc.7 or less, you need to use version
*0.0.5*

When mongoid 2.0.0.rc.8 was released there was a change that prevented
backwards compatibility.

# Installation

## Rails 3

Include it in your Gemfile:

    gem 'slugoid'

And run bundler

    bundle install

# Usage

To use it, all you have to do is call *acts_as_slugoid* in your Mongoid::Document

    class Project
      include Mongoid::Document

      acts_as_slugoid
    end

By default, this will declare a field on the Document called :slug and will try to generate the slug from
a field called :name.

## Options

### :generate_from

If you want to change the field to generate the slug you can use the :generate_from option:

    class Organization
      include Mongoid::Document

      field :alternative_name
      acts_as_slugoid :generate_from => :alternative_name
    end

This will generate the slug form a field called :alternative_name.

### :store_as

If you want to change the field where the slug is stored you can use the :store_as option:

    class Organization
      include Mongoid::Document

      field :name
      acts_as_slugoid :store_as => :alternative_slug
    end

Now it will store the slug in a field called :alternative_slug. If the specified field is not defined
on the Document it will be automatically declared, so adding:

    field :alternative_slug

is optional.

## find

To make things transparent and easy, by default, the find method of the acts_as_slugoid Documents will look for the object by the slug, not the id.

So, if you had the Project class configured as the example above:

    @project = Project.create(:name => "Name")

    Project.find(@project.to_param)                               #=> @project

If, for any reason, you have to look for the object using its id, you have to be explicit:

    @project = Project.create(:name => "Name")

    Project.find(:first, :conditions => {:_id => @project.id})    #=> @project
    Project.where(:_id => @project.id)                            #=> @project

The *find* behavior for the other Mongoid::Documents remains the same.
